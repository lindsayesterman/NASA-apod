**The problem:**


1. 43% of people still send most of their mail on paper. This wastes paper, time, money, and is harmful towards the environment. We need to come up with innovative and fun communication technologies to help move these people in the direction of digital mail. 

2. Thoughtfulness and apppreciation are necessary in most relationships, but it is hard to take time out of your day to buy someone a gift, etc. Digital APOD postcards allow people to send meaningful and thoughtful messages in under 5 minutes. Keep those relationships strong!

3. It is your anniversary tomorrow, you totally forgot. Send your spouse a personal note with a picture taken of the stars the first day you met. Digital APOD postcards has got you!
